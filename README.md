# WhosSlideIsIt
Fun, hacking-based slide shows you're welcome to use for playing Slideshow Karaoke, or "Whos Slide Is it?".

We love playing this game at conferences and internal team meetings and wanted to share a few of the slides that we've made for that.<br>
We've had some good laughs with them, and hope you can do the same.<br>
